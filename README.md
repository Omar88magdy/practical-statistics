## Introduction  
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. It is a fundamental technique used in marketing, product development, and user experience optimization.

This repository contains the tools and resources necessary to conduct A/B tests effectively. By systematically varying elements of a product or website and analyzing user responses, we can make data-driven decisions to improve performance, engagement, and conversion rates.

In this README, we'll provide an overview of A/B testing, its importance, and how to use this framework to implement and analyze experiments. Whether you're a developer, marketer, or data scientist, understanding and leveraging A/B testing can significantly enhance your ability to optimize products and user experiences.

Let's dive in and explore the world of A/B testing togethe
