## Introduction  
In this project, AI-based smart surveillance system capable of automatically detecting different actions was implemented on the Zewail City video surveillance system.
The system reached a recall of 80% and a precision of 70% without fine-tuning using custom data. The system provided different features for the end-user through its graphical interface allowing for easy and convenient data retrieval.

    - The *timestamp* indicating the start and end of the action.
    - The *Building* and *location* where the action happened.
    - The *confidence* of the predicted action.

2- The user can filter by:

    - Actions
