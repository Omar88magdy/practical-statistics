## Introduction  
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. It is a fundamental technique used in marketing, product development, and user experience optimization.

This repository contains the tools and resources necessary to conduct A/B tests effectively. By systematically varying elements of a product or website and analyzing user responses, we can make data-driven decisions to improve performance, engagement, and conversion rates.

In this README, we'll provide an overview of A/B testing, its importance, and how to use this framework to implement and analyze experiments. Whether you're a developer, marketer, or data scientist, understanding and leveraging A/B testing can significantly enhance your ability to optimize products and user experiences.

Let's dive in and explore the world of A/B testing togethe


## Hypothesis

###That is the most important part
You start first by assuming for example that the new page/strategy/method etc.., will be significantly better than the previous one you have 
<br>
strating from this point we can walk along our assumption to try proving if it's really working or not.
<br>
so how we can decide such decision?

## Features  

**Logs page:** 


1- The user can view the history of actions along with some metadata:

    - The *id* of the *camera* that captured that action.
    - The *timestamp* indicating the start and end of the action.
    - The *Building* and *location* where the action happened.
    - The *confidence* of the predicted action.

2- The user can filter by:

    - Actions
    - Building
    - Location 
    - Camera 
    - Start, end date and time.

**Visualizations page:**  

It provides different visualizations that deliver key insights to the user.
